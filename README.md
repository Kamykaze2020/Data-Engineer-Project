# # The assignment

The input for this assignment is an archive (download [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jF7lnMUffCX8U252MoY7jowb7VedFOp8/view?usp=sharing)) containing 3 datasets with data about the same companies from 3 different sources: 

1. Facebook (facebook dataset.csv)
2. Google (google dataset.csv)
3. Company Website (website dataset.csv)

The final purpose of this exercise is to create a 4th dataset that contains the other 3 and, by joining them, we should reach a better accuracy on common columns. The columns that interest us the most are Category, Address (country, region...), Phone, Company names.
